Project Part 3

This is a working demo of the final projec part 3.  I encounter a few bugs and was not able to complete all the use cases.
I will provide a list of all working use cases and tell you what specifically is working and what is no.
First, the tardiness of Part III is due to me getting COVID-19 for one week and then followed up by me 
getting the Flu.  This is the reason as to why I was not able to hand the project in on time,
as well as when I was healthy there was too much work and too little time for me for all my courses. 

In terms of what this simple airline registrartion can do:
Login/logout and Register for both Airline Staff and Customers 
Customer can view their flights and show future flights 
Customer can search for flights 
Customer can purchase tickets
Customer can Cancel a trip 
Customer can ONLY view total spending 
Customer CANNOT give ratings 

Airline Staff login/logout/Register
Airline Staff can View flights HOWEVER CANNOt use a date range 
Airline Staff can search for all flights and ones with their Airline 
Airline Staff can create new flights 
Airline Staff can Change flight Status 
Airline Staff can add airplanes 
Airline Staff can add Airports 
Airline Staff CANNOT view flight ratings
Airline Staff CANNOT view frequent customers 
Airline Staff CANNOT view reports or earned revenue 

BUGS encountered:

On my end everything that is specified above worked with my database; however with the 
Airline Staff I encounted some wierd 404 errors when trying to access some pages as of today when 
it worked yesterday.  I also provided the .sql file with my database in the folder.
